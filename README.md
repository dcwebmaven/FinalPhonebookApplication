# FinalPhonebookApplication
This AJAX project uses Google Maps API to create a fully functioning phonebook app.

The objective/specs for this project were as follows:

This phonebook application MUST include all of the following: 

A first name, last name, address, phone number, email address, and image for each phonebook entry. The email address should be clickable using mailto.
The ability to search by first name or last name. These searches should be case-insenstive.
The ability to display partial matches when searching for either first or last name.
Error checking to display the appropriate messages to the user if there are no matches found.
Use of the Google Maps API, including markers, zoom/pan, and info windows.
A welcome cookie.
Cookies used to display the names most recently searched for, and a way to search these names again without having the user type the entry into the search text field.
Code to make your application as friendly as possible.
